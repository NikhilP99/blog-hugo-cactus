Hello,

I'm Nikhil Patel, a graduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering (Shh...), IIT Kharagpur and currently employed as SDE in Jio Platforms Limited.

I have a keen interest in software development, specifically in Backend development, DevOps and automation. My weapons of choice are JavaScript and Python. I like to create scripts, bots, jobs to automate small and redundant tasks. I'm always excited about the endless possibilities that the world of programming offers and the impact technology has over our lives.

Another thing which changes lives? Music. And that's what I would do for a living if I could. I rarely watch TV series or movies, I prefer gaming instead. Guitar and books are my go to leisure activities.

DMs are always open. Find me on:
