Hello,

I'm Nikhil Patel, a graduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering (Shh...), IIT Kharagpur and currently employed as SDE in Jio Platforms Limited.

I have a keen interest in software development specifically in Backend development, DevOps and automation. I like to create scripts,bots,jobs to automate small and redundant tasks. I'm very intrigued with the impact technology have over our lives these days.

Another thing which changes lives? Music. And that's what I would do for a living if I could. I rarely watch TV series or movies, I'd rather read a fiction book. Gaming and guitar are my go to leisure activities.

DMs are always open. Find me on:
